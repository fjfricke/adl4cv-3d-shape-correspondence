\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

This work will use existing datasets containing isometric shapes such as FAUST \citep{bogo_faust_2014} containing 30 human scans in 10 different poses and 3D Menagerie \citep{zuffi_3d_2017} containing 41 scans of different animals. For comparability with \citet{abdelreheem_zero-shot_2023}, we want to measure the standard average Geodesic Error as in \citet{halimi_unsupervised_2019} as well as the Zero-Shot Object Classification Accuracy (ZSClassAcc), the Semantic Region Generation F1-score (SRGen-F1), and the Semantic Regions Intersection-over-Union (SRIoU) \cite{abdelreheem_zero-shot_2023}. As a baseline, we use SATR \cite{abdelreheem_satr_2023} and SAM-3D \cite{abdelreheem_zero-shot_2023}.
