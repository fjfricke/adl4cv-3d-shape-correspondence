\section{Task Description}
\label{sec:task_description}

Similar to \citet{abdelreheem_zero-shot_2023}, this work wants to further the development of zero-shot 3D shape correspondence based on the semantics from vision-language models. In particular, we are interested in automatically finding correspondences between different shapes in isometric objects in different poses. The input to the task are two or more objects or a scene containing isometric objects as well as a prompt containing a list or tree of shape labels to be segmented. In a scene of humans this could be a list containing body parts. The output comprises of a point-wise or region-wise map between corresponding shapes and labels.
This work should compare previous approaches with ours and ascertain the advantages and disadvantages of a voxel based approach.
